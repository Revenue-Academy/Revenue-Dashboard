2) Allows the analysis of tax trends and tax structure.
3) Compares a country’s performance with the average and best performer (Tax Capacity/Tax Gap)
4) Gives information of the Tax buoyancy of the major taxes.
5) Provides the trends of tax rates of the major taxes.
6) Allows comparison of tax performance across regions and income groups.

It is available on an easily accessible Web-based platform. it currently uses tax collection data but will be expanded to include other relevant data such as C-efficiency, METR & AETR.

The latest year for which data is available is 2020. A HIGH FREQUENCY REVENUE DASHBOARD that provides more recent revenue data from different countries on a monthly/quarterly basis will be piloted soon.
